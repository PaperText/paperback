Features
--------
- Uses modern async typed python framework [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Manages package in `pyproject.toml` with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Implements module system with 3 types of modules 
    managed by python's package manager `pip`
- Has a multilayer configuration system,
    capable of picking up environment variables with separators

Usage
-----
1. Install `paperback` with any `auth` and `docs` modules.
    You can use standard implementation, 
    i.e. [`papertext_auth`]() and [`papertext_docs`]().
2. Install any miscellaneous modules you want.
3. Run paperback with `paperback run --create-config`\
Note 📓:\
    You don't need to always run paperback with `--create-config` flag.
    After first startup you can just use `paperback run`.
4. Optionally, configure paperback at `~/.paperback/config.toml`

Development
-----------
1. install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/),
    preferably with [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/)
1. download `paperback` from `git` and `cd` into it
1. change `poetry`'s local `virualenvs.path` configuration
    to your preferred virtualenv location with this command:
    `poetry config virtualenvs.path "{your location goes here}" --local`
1. run `poetry install`

You're all set up. Poetry will install dependencies and
    paperback in development mode.

If you want to test your changes you can test them with `paperback run --debug`

After you're done, push your changes to git.

Container
---------
Paperback is also available as docker-compliant container.

#### Requirements
Private SSH key with access to pyexling repository.
To pass this key, use `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

You can configure used modules with `MODULES` environment variable.

Example of usage:

Basic:

Advanced:

note 📓: this requires SSH_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable and mounts
local instances of papertext_auth and papertext_docs.
This also requires postgres container for auth module.
```shell script
podman build . --tag paperback && \
podman run -it --rm \
  -v ../papertext_auth:/root/Projects/papertext_auth:z \
  -v ../papertext_docs:/root/Projects/papertext_docs:z \
  -e SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -e MODULES="[/root/Projects/papertext_auth,/root/Projects/papertext_docs]" \
  --network host \
  --name paperback paperback
```
